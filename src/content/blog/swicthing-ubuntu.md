I don't really care about what Operating System I use. by that I mean I don't take side on which OS is superior and how Linux is best for programmer or how windows is bloated or on how weird MacOS is.

I use whatever... I use Windows for daily use. I use Linux on Servers and I discover work arounds Mac OS. and i thought I never have to think about my choice of OS until...
my Laptop Stopped charging and suddenly I have no PC to work with..
And now, with 3-4 projects with close deadlines at hand, I (somewhat stupidly) thought now would be the best time to learn how to use Ubuntu.

## The Switch

I decided to install Ubuntu on an old PC with just 4GB of RAM. This machine had been collecting dust for years, but it was my only immediate option. I hoped that Ubuntu’s reputation for being lightweight and efficient would help breathe new life into the aging hardware. After making a bootable USB and formatting the PC,  And I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was setup it I thought their would be issues with disk formatting since Linux uses a different format than windows. 

It even game me an option to try Ubuntu or installing it alongside windows. However, I committed to installing Ubuntu without trying it first, as a way to "burn the ships," so to speak. This meant fully embracing the change and forcing myself to adapt quickly. Or else, I’d find myself constantly switching back and forth, never fully committing to learning the new system.

## First Impressions

The first thing I did on Ubuntu was to customize it to my liking. I changed the wallpaper, switched up the theme, and adjusted the screen resolution. I also re-positioned the "dock" to the bottom of the screen, centered the icons, and made them smaller. The customization process went smoothly, and I appreciated the flexibility Ubuntu offered.

However, it was at this stage that I realized my biggest challenge would not be the UI itself, but rather my own muscle memory. Years of using Windows systems had ingrained certain habits and shortcuts into my workflow, and the biggest offender was the "Windows key," or as it's known in Ubuntu, the Super key.

In Windows, pressing the Windows key opens the Start menu, a feature that quickly became second nature. On Ubuntu, however, the Super key opens the "Activities Overview." While this feature is useful in its own right, it felt alien and somewhat useless to me at first. I thought to myself, “It’s no big deal; I can retrain my brain to adapt to a different key function.” But I quickly realized that the Windows key was just the beginning.

On Windows, I was accustomed to using the Windows key to perform various tasks with ease:

- To open an app like VS Code, I’d hit the Start key, type the first 1-3 letters of the app's name, and press Enter.
- To access the clipboard, I’d use Windows + V.
- For taking screenshots, I’d use Windows + S.
  
These shortcuts were deeply embedded in my workflow, and their absence on Ubuntu was jarring. The realization hit me hard: my entire approach to navigating and managing my system was built around these key combinations. The process of switching to Ubuntu felt overwhelming as I began to appreciate just how much I had relied on these shortcuts.

But then I discovered that Ubuntu's customizability is on a whole different level.

## The Customization 

On Windows, "customization" means changing small things to suit your needs, but you can't really change anything big or substantial. If you don't like that the shortcut for the clipboard is Windows + V, then sucks to be you; you can't really change it (without having to mess with the code or install third-party apps, which Windows doesn't like). But on Ubuntu, you can change **everything**.

1. **Keybindings**: Changing keybindings in Ubuntu is a breeze. If I wanted to change a shortcut, I just went into the settings, navigated to the keyboard shortcuts section, and easily reassigned the keys. I set up custom shortcuts for opening applications, managing windows, and more. This level of control was refreshing and allowed me to tailor the system to my preferences effortlessly.
   
2. **GNOME Extensions**: Ubuntu’s GNOME desktop environment supports extensions, which can significantly enhance and customize the user experience. There’s an extension for almost everything. Want to add a weather widget to your taskbar? There’s an extension for that. Need more advanced window management features? There’s an extension for that too. The ability to easily install and manage these extensions meant I could fine-tune Ubuntu to work exactly how I wanted it to.
   
3. **Automating Tasks via CLI**: One of the powerful aspects of Ubuntu is the command-line interface (CLI). With a bit of scripting, I could automate tasks that would require third-party software or complicated setups on Windows. For example, setting up script that bulk renames files in a folder , or a command that fuzzy finds a project in my development and opens it in . This capability not only saved me time but also opened up a world of possibilities for streamlining my workflow.

Exploring these customization options made me realize what Ubuntu's real appeal is — it is a platform that offers unparalleled flexibility and control. The initial frustration of adapting to a new system gave way to a sense of empowerment as I discovered how to mold Ubuntu to fit my exact needs. This level of customization was something I had never experienced on Windows, and it made the switch to Ubuntu feel less like a compromise and more like an upgrade.


## Security

Security was another area where Ubuntu stood out. I had experienced my fair share of security issues on Windows. There was this one time when my MySQL database got hacked because I was running it on XAMPP with minimal security configurations. It was a nightmare. I lost crucial data, and it took me days to restore everything and beef up the security. Another time, my entire PC had to be reset because of ransomware. I lost all my files and had to start from scratch, which was not only frustrating but also a massive waste of time.

On Ubuntu, security felt much more robust right out of the box. The default user is not granted administrative privileges, which prevents accidental system-wide changes and makes it harder for malware to gain a foothold. Updates are managed through a centralized system, ensuring that all installed software receives timely security patches.

Moreover, Ubuntu's built-in firewall, uncomplicated firewall (UFW), and SELinux policies add additional layers of security. By simply enabling and configuring these tools, I could secure my system against many common threats. This level of security, combined with the ability to easily manage updates and permissions, gave me peace of mind that my data and system were far less vulnerable than they had been on Windows.

In Ubuntu, the reliance on the terminal and scripting also plays a role in security. Unlike Windows, where many administrative tasks require navigating through various GUI elements, Ubuntu allows for precise control over the system through the command line. This not only made it easier to automate security-related tasks but also ensured that I could understand and manage exactly what was happening on my system.

Switching to Ubuntu was initially a leap into the unknown, filled with challenges and adjustments. However, the powerful customization options and enhanced security features made it a decision I didn’t regret. Ubuntu turned out to be not just a viable alternative but a superior choice in many ways.


## Conclusion

It's been a few days, and I've grown so accustomed to using Ubuntu that I'm comfortable even playing Minecraft on it. Now that my laptop is repaired, I only use it to transfer files to my Ubuntu PC or for graphic design work. What started as a desperate move to keep up with project deadlines turned into an eye-opening experience. Sure, there were moments of frustration and the inevitable learning curve, but the customization options and security features won me over.

I went from scrambling to adapt to a new system to actually enjoying the flexibility and control Ubuntu offers. It’s funny how a broken laptop pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me realize there’s more to operating systems than just familiarity. Ubuntu might not be perfect, but it’s taught me that sometimes, the best way to learn and grow is to dive into the unknown. Now, I feel more equipped to handle whatever tech challenges come my way, whether it’s on Windows, Linux, or even macOS. Who knew a charging issue could lead to such a rewarding adventure?
